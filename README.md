## AWS Cloud foundations course

## AWS introductory module
- Gives us a general overview of what are we supposed to expect from the whole course, and how to use AWS academy.


## Module 1 - Cloud concepts overview

**INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD COMPUTING**

- What is cloud computing?
  - **on demand delivery of  IT resources via the internet with pay as you go pricing.**
  - enables you to stop thinking of you **infrastructure** as hardware, instead, **think of it as software**
  
- Infrastructure as hardware
  -  Hardware solutions are physical
  -  require staff, space, security, planning, and capital expenditure
  -  You need to predict your needs, capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks
  -  if you don't reach your expected peak, then you are paying extra resources unused
  -  but if you exceed your maximum peak, then you dont have the capacity to meet your needs
  -  and if your needs change, you must spend the time, money and resources required to implement a new solution
 
- Infrastrucutre as software
  - Flexible
  - cna change more quickly, easy and cost-effectively than hardware solutions
  - eliminate heavy-lifting tasks, like maintenance capacity planning.
  - enables to focus on what matters


3 Main cloud service models

  - **IaaS (infrastructure as a Service)**: basic building blocks for cloud it and provide you with access to networking features, computers and data storage space. Highest level of flexibility and management over your IT resources
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service**) : reduce you the need of manage the underlying infrastructure, usually hardware and Operating systems, and enables you to focus on the deployment and management of your apps
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: provides with a complete product, that the service provider runs and manage. Most cases refers to end user appss. You DONT HAVE to worry about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructured is managed. just think about how to use that particular piece of software


Cloud computing deployment models

-** Cloud based app**: fully developed in the cloud. apps can either be created on the cloud or migrated to it.
- **Hybrid**  : is a way to connect your existing between cloud based infrastructure and apps and existing resources that are not in the cloud.
- **On-premises** (private cloud): use virtualization and resource management tools, it does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing, sometimes provide dedicated resources

Similarities between AWS and traditional IT

Almost anything you can implement with traditional IT can also be implemented as an AWs cloud computing service

**ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING**

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense: capex are funds that a company uses to aquire, upgrade and maintain physical assests, (basically you pay it wheter you use it or not)
 Instead, variable expenses you pay only for the amount you consume, maintenance is reduced
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale: big cloud providors have huge amounts of costumers, so they can get the resourses at lower prices, which means that the lower prices will go as well to the costumers when paying just what you use
3. Stop guessing capacity: Eliminate the guessing about your infrastrucutre capacity needs. With cloud computing you can access as much or as little as you need in the moment, scaling up and down as required.
4. Increase speed and agility: IT resources are just a click away, you reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to minutes.
5. stop spending money on running and mainaining data centers: Focus on the business needs instead of the heavy lifting, of racking stacking and powering servers
6. Go global in minutes: You can deploy an app in multiple regions whith just a few clicks.


**INTRODUCTION TO AMAZON WEB SERVICES (AWS)**

What is a web service?

- Any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet in a standarized format.\
- It is not tied to any operating system or programming languaje. It is self describing via an interface definition file and it is **discoverable**

AWS

- AWS is a secure platform that offers a broad set of cloud based products
- Delivered over the internet and you have on demand access to IT resources
- offers flexibility
- you can pay for only the resources that you use, operational expense
- AWS services work together like building blocks, to build sophisticated and scalable solutions

Which to use depend on your business needs and tech requirements

Three ways to interact with AWS

1. AWS management console. Graphical interface
2. CLI. Access to services by discrete commands or scripts
3. Software DEvelopmennt Kits (SDKs). Access services directly from you code.


**MOVING TO THE AWS CLOUD, THE CLOUD ADOPTION FRAMEWORK**

- For most organizations, cloud adaption does not happen immediately
- **technology, people and processes** are the three things that must be in alignment for a successful cloud adaption
